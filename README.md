think up some interfaces
interface Item {
    string Id
    string Name
    kind = [item, material, cargo]
}

interface MatesrialItem extends Item {
    size_x
    size_y
}
// both material and cargo have this.
interface Size extends Item {
    size_x
    size_y
}

interface Equippable {
    EqiupmentSlotId slot
}

interface Cargo {
    kind = "cargo"
}

interface Material {
    kind = "material"
}

interface InventoryItem {
    kind = "item"
}

interface Weapon {
    weapon_type [] // this ties into the weapon skill tree.

}

interface Stats {
    key - stat-id : value
}

interface Armor {
    armor_type [heavy, medium, light]
}

interface Vendor {
    location ?
}
